# Temperature-Sensing-Calculator
I created a temperature sensing calculator using Arduino Uno. It can sense the temperature in degrees celsius and perform basic calculator operations(+, -, /, *).

I had to download the keypad library which you can find here: https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad/
